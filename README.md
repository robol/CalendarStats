# CalendarStats

CalendarStats is a simple Qt application that counts the number of events in a given year in
an ICS file. The app also presents a breakdown of the events occurred in each month of the
year. 

CalendarStats has been tested on the ICS files produced by Google Calendar. Please note that
only the start date of the events is taken into account, and the repeat options are completely
ignored.
